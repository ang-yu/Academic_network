Building Academic Networks Dataset: A Code Guide to Identifying Faculty Twitter Accounts

V1. screenName 
Screen name is the username of the Twitter account. The format is the username with no @. 

Instructions:
    1. Search for the name with and without the middle name under "People" tab of Twitter's own search tool

    2. If multiple accounts appear, check each of them to see whether it is the person who are looking for. 
       a. Pay attention to whether this person follows any sociologists or sociology departments/journals and whether this person tweeted anything sociological. 
       b. The accounts following this person can also give you a hint, but do not confirm a match solely based on that, because sociologists may mistakenly follow someone whose account looks like their friend's. 
       c. If still uncertain, try to see whether the profile photo somehow match the person's photo on the departmental website.

    3. If no account pops up, search under "Top" tab using name+sociology and name+school name to see if someone has tweeted to the faculty of interest. 
    
    4. Once we indentify the faculty's twitter account, copy paste the screenname (next to @) under the display name.
