For RAs potentially available in the furture

1. Search for the name with and without the middle name under the people tab of Twitter's own search tool

2. If multiple accounts appear, check each of them to see whether it is the person who are looking for. 
Pay attention to whether this person follows any sociologists or sociology departments/journals and whether this person tweeted anything sociological.
The accounts following this person can also give you a hint, but do not confirm a match solely based on that, because sociologists may mistakenly follow someone whose account looks like their friend's. 

3. If no account pops up, try search name+sociology and name+school name
